# Metabarcoding using QIIME2 to Explore Soil Biodiversity

This project focuses on processing sequencing data from soil samples to investigate bacterial biodiversity using the 16S rRNA gene.

### Overview

This repository contains all the necessary scripts, workflows, and guidelines for:
* Processing and analyzing 16S sequencing data using QIIME2.
* Generating meaningful insights into microbial communities in soil ecosystems.
  
This repository will guide you through the metabarcoding workflow from raw data to biodiversity analysis.


### Workflow
1. Data Import
Prepare and import your sequencing data into QIIME2.

2. Quality Control
Perform quality filtering and trimming using DADA2 for denoising.

3. Clustering
Clusering sequences similar at 97% into OTUs.

3. Taxonomic Classification
Assign taxonomy to representative sequences using pre-trained classifiers and databases like SILVA or Greengenes.

5. Diversity Analysis
Explore aplha diversity (Richness, Shannon index) and beta diversity (PCoA plots, PERMANOVA tests)

5. Visualization
Generate visualizations, such as taxonomic bar plots and PCoA plots for community composition.
